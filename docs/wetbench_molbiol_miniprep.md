# Miniprep E.Coli

Extraction of plasmid DNA from E.Coli

>***Duration: 1h***
>***Adapted from: Sambrook & Russell, 2001*** 

#### Materials
- Falcon tubes 15mL
- Eppendorf tubes 2mL
- Microcentrifuge tubes 1.5 mL
- A basket filled with ice

#### Equipment
- Microcentrifuge
- Dry incubator at 37°
- Shaking incubator at 37°C

#### Solutions
- Solution 1: Glucose 50mM, EDTA 10mM, Tris 25mM pH8
- Solution 2: NaOH 0.2M, SDS 1%
- Sodium acetate 3M pH5.2
- EtOH 100% cold
- EtOH 70% cold
- RNAse A 10μg/mL
- TY medium
- Appropriate antibiotic
- Glycerol 30% sterilized

## Procedure
1. In a sterile falcon, inoculate the selected recombinant colony in 3mL TY medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic
2. Incubate at 37°C in a shaking incubator overnight (~12h)
3. Collect 1.5mL of overnight culture in a sterile 2mL eppendorf
4. Centrifuge for 5 min at 13.000 rpm . Dischardge the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in  100μL of Solution 1
5. Incubate  for 5min at room temperature
6. Add 200μl of Solution 2 to the suspension. Invert to mix
7. Incubate for 5 min on ice
8. Add 150μl of sodium acetate and mix by inverting
9. Incubate 5min on ice. Centrifuge at 13.000 rpm for 5min 
10. Carefully collect 400 μLμl of supernatant and place in sterile 2mL tubes. DO NOT PICK UP ANY PRECIPITATE!
11. Add 1 volume of phenol/chloroform (or phenol only) and mix well by pipetting up and down
12. Centrifuge at 13.000 rpm for 5min
13. Collect the aqueous phase, transfer in new 2mL eppendorf and add 3 volume of EtOH 100%
14. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature
15. Centrifuge for 5 min at 13.000 , dischardge the supernatant with the help of a pipette. BE CAREFUL NOT TO PICK UP ANY OF THE PRECIPITATE.
16. Add 3 volumes of EtOH 70% to wash. Repeat 2-3 more times
17. Centrifuge for 5 min at 13.000 rpm
18. Dischardge the supernatant and let evaporate any EtOH residue from the tubes for 10-15 min at room temperature.
19. Resuspend the pellet (plasmid DNA) in 50μl of sterilized water.
20. Analyze the plasmid DNA extracted by agarose gel electrophoresis.
21. Store the plasmid DNA at -20°C.
22. Create a stab of the selected plasmid from the culture collected at point 3 and add glycerol 30%. Store at -80°C.



## Common problems, troubleshooting and solutions
- The plasmid DNA could contain RNA contamination. In this case add 20μg of RNAse A (2μL) and incubate for 30' at 37°-dry incubator.
