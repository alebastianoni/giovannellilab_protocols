# Extended protocol name

**OBJ**: Protocol objective

>***Duration: protocol duration goes here***

#### Materials
- list all the material

#### Equipment
- list all the qeuipment

#### Solutions
- list the necessary solutions. Be sure to include the concentration, pH and notes on the preparation or and any reference to the protocols to prepare them

## Procedure
1. List every step of the protocol here
2. Include all informations about incubation times and temperature and instrument steps like:  Centrifuge 10' @ 7000 rpm
3. Don't forget to add information on the storage and data collection if needed
4. Save the protocol with a meaningful name. We have a basic division of protocols starting with a Wetbench/Field/InSilico division, followed by the area (such as MolBiol, Biochem, Cultures, Geochem) and by the name. For example a protocol for extracting DNA from sediment will be named Wetbench_MolBiol_SedimentDNA.md and a protocol for preserving fluid samples in the filed will be Field_MolBiol_FluidPreservation.md

## Expected results (quantitative information, graphics, images)
Describe the expected results and if possible include a visual example (i.e. a picture, table or graph)

## Common problems, troubleshooting and solutions
- List all common problems and solutions

## Calculations
A detailed explanation of any formula used to convert or calculate the final data from the raw input should be included here. Please refer to any additional software needed or _in silico_ protocol. Please be sure to upload a .ods file with the example calculations along with this protocol if necessary. Use the same filename adding _calculation at the end. For example Wetbench_SedimentDNA_calculations.ods. You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) directly in StackEdit like:
$$
BAR=\frac{B-A}{B+A}
$$
A math cheatsheet to write formulas can be found in [KaTex documentation page](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).
