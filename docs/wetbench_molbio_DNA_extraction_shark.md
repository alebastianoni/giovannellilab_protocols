# Genomic DNA Extraction from shark skin

Extraction of genomic host DNA from a piece of shark skin preserved frozen.

>***Duration***: 2.5h + overnight DNA precipitation +1h

>***Adapted from: *** Donato Giovannelli sediment DNA extraction with suggestions from Sergio Stefanni

#### Materials
- 2 ml Eppendorf tube (a total of 5 for each samples)
- 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (one of each samples)

#### Equipment
- bench-top microcentrifuge up to 16.000 xg
- vortex
- Benchtop shaking incubator @ 52 °C
- Chemical Hood
- Pipets P1000 and P200

#### Solutions
- Extraction buffer EB : (100 mM Na2HPO4 pH 8, 100mM tris-HCL pH 8, 100 mM EDTA pH 8, 1,5 M NaCl, 1% CTAB )
- SDS 20%
- Lysozime 100 mg/ml
- Proteinase K 20 mg/ml
- Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1
- Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol 24:1
- Isopropanol 100 %
- Sodium Acetate 3M
- Ethanol 70% ice cold
- Tris Buffer

#### Procedure
1. Dry the skin
2. Put the piece of skin on an aluminum foil, then scrape and fray it with a surgical blade
3. Put the piece of skin in a clean stearilized 2ml tube
3. Add 850 µl of EB (extraction buffer)
4. Add 100 µl of Lysozime (100 mg/ml)
5. Add 5 µl of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml)
6. Add 50 µl of SDS
7. Invert tube
8. Incubate in a benchtop shaking incubator @ 52°C overnight
9. Vortex 1’
10. Centrifuge 3’ @ 14,000 rpm.
11. Recover supernatant
12. Add 1 vol (ca. 1 ml) of Phenol:Chl:IAA
13. Invert 100 times or until emulsion forms
14. Centrifuge 3’ @ 14,000 rpm. Recover aqueous phase (generally the top phase) to clean 2 ml tube
15. Add 1 vol Chl:IAA. Invert 100 times or until emulsion forms.
16. Centrifuge 3’ @ 14,000 rpm. Recover aqueous phase (generally top phase) to clean 2 ml tube
16. Add 0.1 vol of Na-Acetate and 0.7 vol of Isopropanol
17. Invert several times
18. Refrigerate @ -20 °C for 1h 20’
19. Centrifuge 30’ @ 14,000 rpm. Carefully remove supernatant
20. Add 0.5 ml of EtOH 70% ice cold and invert tube several times
21. Centrifuge 5’ @ 14,000 rpm. Carefully remove supernatant. Air dry for ca. 20’ @ 37 °C with the Eppendorf open
22. Resuspend in 50 µl of tris buffer (C6)
23. Run 3 µl on 1- 1.5% agarose gel to check the presence of gDNA and preserve @ -20

#### Expected results
Expect a clear high molecular weight band (~20 kb or higher) from each sample. A small amount of DNA degradation in the form of a smear can be expected. Reduce vortexing and pipetting steps if this becomes excessive.

#### Common problems, troubleshooting and solutions
- It’s possible that the 20’ at @ 37°C are not enough to dry the sample; after 20’ check the sample and maybe wait 10’ more
- If the skin sample is very think, remove the outside skin and/or cut it in smaller pieces

#### Calculations
