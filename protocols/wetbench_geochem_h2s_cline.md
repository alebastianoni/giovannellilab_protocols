# Measuring total sulfide (S2-) with the Methylene Blue Method

## Protocol objective
Determine total sulfide in fluid samples, with salinity concentrations below 40 ‰, sulfite up to 100 μM and sulfide concentrations below 20 μg/L.
In case of high sulfide concentrations (> 20 μg/L), color development will not take place, and dilutions should be performed.
If the sample has higher salinity contents, the reader is directed to the Cord-Ruwish (1989) for the colorimetric determination of sulfide using copper sulfate.


## Introduction

Sulfide is often present in environmental samples, produced either biologically by decomposition of organic matter and bacterial reduction of sulfate or inorganically by volcanic degassing. There are four categories of sulfide in water and sediment samples, operationally defined as follows

### Total Sulfide

includes dissolved H2S and HS- and acid-volatile metallic sulfides present in particulate matter. The pka2 of H2S is so high that the concentration of S2- is negligible at all pH values. Copper and silver sulfides are so insoluble that they do not respond in ordinary sulfide determinations.

### Dissolved sulfide
the fraction remaining after suspended solids have been removed by flocculation and settling. Flocculation and settling are used to separate dissolved and particulate sulfide because sulfide may be oxidized during filtration. Centrifugation also may be used.

### Acid-volatile sulfide:
includes amorphous iron monosulfides, including mackinawite ($FeS$), greigite ($Fe_{3}S_{4}$), and pyrrhotite ($FeS$), and amorphous monosulfides of other metals. Pyrite, another sulfide mineral, is not included in the acid-volatile sulfides.

### Un-ionized hydrogen sulfide:
can be calculated from the concentration of dissolved sulfide, the sample pH, and the conditional ionization constant of H2S.
The Methylene blue method for determining total sulfide (Cline, 1969) is based on the reaction of sulfide, ferric chloride, and dimethyl-*p*-phenylen-di-amine to produce methylene blue. Ammonium phosphate is
added after color development to remove the ferric chloride color. The procedure is applicable at sulfide concentrations between 0.1 and 40.0 mg/L (Gong, 2020).
It is widely used for analyzing water samples.

## Interferences
Samples should be pretreated to remove interferences due to sulfite, thiosulfite, iodine, barium  other soluble substances,
with the exception of ferrocyanide, by first precipitating ZnS,
removing the supernatant, and replacing it with distilled water.
To prevent matrix effects, samples should be filtered using a 0.2 µm filter
before performing the analysis.
If sulfide concentration is expected to be higher than 20 μg/L, sample *must* be diluted with deionized water before performing the analysis (Cline, 1969; Gong, 2020)

## Sample preservation
Sulfide is a highly reactive species, so immediate analysis should be preferred.
If not possible, samples should be preserved adding 2mL of Zinc Acetate 1M to 6mL of the sample.

### Duration:
20 min for color development, plus 20 min of sample prep
*(excluding reagent and degassed water preparation)*

### Materials
- 1 cm polystyrene disposable cuvettes (1 mL)
- 15 mL falcon tubes or eppendorf tubes
- 1000µL and 100 µL Pipettes  for delivering the methylene blue solution

### Equipment
- Spectrophotometer UV-VIS for use at a wavelength of 664 nm or 670 nm
- Chemical hood

### Solutions (after the Standard Methods of the American Public Health Association (APHA)).
- Zinc acetate solution, 1 M: dissolve 220g of 
$Zn(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2} \cdot 2H_{2}O$ in 870 mL of ultrapure water, this makes a 1L solution
- Sodium hydroxide solution, 6M.
- 1+1 Sulfuric acid solution: prepare 200 mL by mixing in equal parts concentrated H2SO4 and distilled water. Store in a clear glass reagent bottle.
- Sulfuric Acid, 18M (concentrated).
- HCl solution, 6M: prepare 200 mL by diluting 100 mL of concentrated HCl (12M) with 100 mL of milliQ water.
- Stock Sulfide solution, 0.03 M (1000 ppm): prepare with sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S . 9H2O) prepared with degassed water to avoid oxidation of the S2- when in contact with atmospheric O2.
- Amine-sulfuric acid stock solution, 0.74 M: prepare 100 mL weighing 17.33 g of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylendiamine sulfate and dissolve it in an iced mixture of 50 mL of conc H2SO4 and 20 mL MilliQ Water. Cool and dilute to 100 mL with MilliQ water. Store it in a dark glass bottle
- Amine-sulfuric acid reagent, 0.02  M: for a final volume of 10 mL, dilute 0.25 mL amine-sulfate acid stock solution in 9.75 mL of 1+1 H2SO4 solution. Store in a dark glass bottle.
- Ferric chloride solution, 0.098 M: weigh approx. 1.6 g of FeCl3 and dissolve it in 100 mL of 6M HCl
- $H_{2}S$ stock solution, 1000 ppm: For preparation instructions see the procedure section.
- Sulfide standards from 1 to 8 mg/L of S2-. These solutions need to be prepared daily, and can be stocked for the duration of the essay in 15 mL falcon tubes.
- Degassed water: prepare an adequate volumes of 18.2mΩ-cm deionized (DI) water are spurged with ultra high purity N2 gas for a minimum of 1 h and sealed in a vial with a rubber septum.

### Sample preservation procedure
Add an excess volume of the 1M zinc acetate solution (2 mL) into a 15 mL falcon tube, trying to avoid the formation of an excessively bulky precipitate that settles readily. If samples have a pH below 3, add enough NaOH 6M to raise pH to 9 or above. Take into account that the reaction between zinc acetate and hydrogen sulfide has a 1:1 stoichiometry, which means that the maximum amount of hydrogen sulfide that could react is controlled by the amount of zinc acetate added. Thus, by adding 1mL of zinc acetate solution and 5 mL of sample, a maximum concentration of hydrogen sulfide of 0,17 M (170mM) could be detected.

### Methilene-Blue Procedure
***Preparation of 0.03 M (1000 mg/L) stock sulfide solution***
1. Remove single crystals of $Na_{2}S \cdot 9H_{2}O$ from reagent bottle with nonmetallic tweezers; quickly rinse in degassed reagent water to remove surface contamination. Weighing 0.75 g $Na_{2}S \cdot 9H_{2}O$ diluted to a final volume of 100 mL will give a stock solution of which 1.00 mL = 1.00 mg $S^{2-}$, which equals a $Na_{2}S \cdot 9H_{2}O$ molar concentration of  0.03M
2. Blot dry the crystals with a tissue, then rapidly transfer to a tared, stoppered weighing bottle containing 5 to 10 mL degassed reagent water. Repeat procedure until desired amount of sodium sulfide is in weighing bottle. Avoid excess agitation and mixing of the solution with atmospheric oxygen.
3. Quantitatively transfer and dilute entire contents of weighing bottle to an appropriate size volumetric flask with degassed reagent water to prepare a known concentration sulfide stock solution.
Standards need to be prepared daily. It is stable only for a few hours.

***Preparation of 1 to 8 mg/L sulfide standards***
1. Dilute the proper volume from the stock $H_{2}S$ solution and bring it to volume with degassed ultra pure water.
Standards should be measured at least 5 times and calculate the average percent error.

Std. concentration (mg/L) |Volume of stock solution (µL) | Final volume of std.  (mL) |
-- | -- | --|
1 | 10 µL | 10 mL
2 | 20 µL | 10 mL
3 | 30 µL | 10 mL
4 | 40 µL | 10 mL
6 | 60 µL | 10 mL
8 | 80 µL | 10 mL

2. Transfer 1.0 mL of both sample and standards to each of two matched test tubes (tube A and tube B). If the sample has been preserved with zinc acetate, shake vigorously before taking the subsample.
Add to **tube A** 66.6 µL of amine-sulfuric acid reagent and 20 µL of FeCl3 solution. Mix immediately by inverting slowly, only once.The presence of S2- will be indicated by the appearance of a blue color in Tube A.
To **tube B**, add 66.6 µL of 1+1  H2SO4 and 20µL of FeCl3 solution and mix. This solution is the blank to be used in step 4 for zeroing the spectrophotometer. Color development takes around 20 min. Standards can be used for a couple of hours.
3. Read the absorbance of **tube A** and **B** at 670 nm using a cell with a light path of 1 cm (this type of cell is suitable for measuring sulfide concentrations from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L). Use shorter or longer light paths for higher or lower concentrations.
4. Zero instrument with an aliquot of the treated sample from **tube B**.
5. Prepare calibration curves on the basis of the colorimetric tests made on Na2S solutions.
6. A linear relationship between concentration and absorbance can be assumed from 0 to 1.0 mg/L.
7. Read sulfide concentration from the calibration curve.


## Expected results of the calibration curve

Std.Conc. (mg/L) |Absorbance
-- | --
 1 |0.219
 2 |0.492
 4 |0.819
 6 |1.206
 8 |1.326

## Common problems, troubleshooting and solutions
- A distinct protocol for the determination of sulfide concentration in samples with high salinity content is under development after Cord-Ruwisch (1985)


## Calculations
Use the equation of the standard curve to calculate the concentration **x**, equivalent to the concentration of sulfide in your sample.
