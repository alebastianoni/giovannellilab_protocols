### **PROTOCOL FOR ANTIBIOGRAM TEST**

 - McFarland protocol is adapted from https://pdf4pro.com/amp/view/mcfarland-standard-dalynn-f76d0.html
- Antibiogram is adapted from Matuschek et al., 2014 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12373)

**MATERIALS:**
- plate 90mm
- falcon tube 15mL
- couvette UV/VIS
- Mueller Hinton media

**EQUIPMENTS:**
- dry incubator at 37°C
- shaking incubator at 37°C
- spectrophotometer UV/VIS
- paper disks

**SOLUTION:**
- appropriate antibiotic

**Procedure:**
1. GLYCEROL STOCK ( -80°C) of your stain
2. STREAK ON MUELLER HINTON AGAR PLATE (12h at 37°C-dry incubator)
3. INOCULATE A SINGLE COLONY IN 5ML OF MUELLER HINTON LIQUID MEDIA (~12h at 37°C-shaking incubator). You need to know the hours passed between the starting of the inoculum and the lecture at the spectrophotometer
4. READ THE OD625 nm VALUE AT SPECTROPHOTOMETER. Dilute the sample 1:10 (100µL of sample in 900µL of liquid media; 0.5 McFarland = 1 - 2 x 108 CFU/mL → OD = 0.08 - 0.1)
5. DILUTE YOUR SAMPLE UNTIL YOU REACH AN  OD625nm VALUE COMPRISES BETWEEN 0.08 AND 0.1
6. PREPARE PLATE WITH A BASE OF MUELLER HINTON AGAR 1.8% (10/15mL)
7. ADD ON THE SURFACE 10mL OF MUELLER HINTON AGAR 0.7% WITH 1 mL OF YOUR SAMPLE (9mL of MH-A 0.7% + 1mL of sample + shaking)
8. AFTER MEDIA SOLIDIFICATION, ADD PAPER DISKS AND WET WITH ANTIBIOTIC (LIQUID VOLUME REQUIRED FOR WET THE DISK IS 5µL)
9. INCUBATE FOR 12h AT 37°C-dry incubator
10. CHECK FOR HALO PRESENCE/ABSENCE OR MEASURE THE DIAMETER
