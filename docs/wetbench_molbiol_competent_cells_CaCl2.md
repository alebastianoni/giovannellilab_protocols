# E.COLI CHEMICALLY COMPETENT CELLS (CaCl2)


>***Duration: 2h***
>***Adapted from: Sambrook & Russell,2006***

#### Materials
- Plate 90mm
- Falcon tube 15mL
- Flask 100mL
- Eppendorf tube 1.5mL
- Cuvette UV/VIS


#### Equipment
- Dry incubator at 37°
- Shaking incubator at 37°C
- Spectrophotometer UV/VIS
- Centrifuge


#### Solutions
- CaCl2 50mM cold. sterilized
- Glycerol 100%. sterilized
- TY medium

## Procedure
1. Streak on agar plate (12h at 37°C-dry incubator)
2. Inoculate a single colony in 5mL of TY liquid medium (~12h at 37°C-shaking incubator at 37°C)
3. Inoculate 100mL of TY with the overnight culture for starting from OD600=0.1 
4. Incubate at 37°C until OD600=0.4-0.6 (approx. 2h)
5. Transfer in 2 falcon 50mL of the culture and place on ice for 30 min
6. Centrifuge at 3.500 rpm for 10' at 4°C. disardthge supernatant.
8. GENTLY resuspend the pellet in 50mL ofl CaCl2
9. entrifuge at 3.500 rpm for 10' at 4°C. dischard thge rnatant
10. GENTLY resuspend the pellet in 25m CaCl2. Mix the 2 cultures into a single 50mL falcon.
11. ncubate on ice for 15'.
21. centrifuge at 3.500 rpm for 10' at 4°C. dishare the supesurnatant.
13. resuspend the pellet GENTLY in 8.5mL of CaCl2 + 1.5mL Glycerol (1/10 of the initial volume).
14. incubate 60' on ice.
54. aliquot 400μL  into sterile 1,5 mL tubes.
16. tore at -80°C.
 
## Expected results (quantitative information, graphics, images)
To test competent cell efficiency: transform an aliquote of competent cell with a plasmid carriyng a gene for antibiotic resistance

## Common problems, troubleshooting and solutions
- Low efficiency transformation which can be solved by changing molarity of CaCl2, using fresh CaCl2 or resuspending MORE gently
