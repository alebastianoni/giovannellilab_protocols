# Chromosomal DNA extraction protocol from pure cultures

##### Adapted by *Giovannelli, 17 Dec 2019* from the DNA Sediment extraction protocol – modified from Deep-Sea and Hydrothermal Vent Sediments *Giovannelli 01 Apr 2011* and, after *Vetriani et al., 1999*

***Duration: 2.5 h + DNA precipitation + ~45h for drying DNA***

#### Materials
- 2 ml Eppendorf tubes (2 tubes for each sample)
- 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (1 for each sample)
- Sterile tips for P1000 and P200

#### Equipment
- Bench-top Microcentrifuge up to 14.000 rpm
- Vortex
- Dry incubator at 37°C
- Water bath warmed at 65°C
- Chemical fume hood
- Pipettes P1000 and P200
- OPTIONAL: NanoDrop 1000
- OPTIONAL: Gel electrophoresis

#### Solutions
- Extraction buffer EX (50mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl)
- SDS 20%
- Lysozyme 100 mg/ml
- Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1
- Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol 24:1
- Isopropanol 100%
- Sodium Acetate 3M pH  5.2
- Ethanol 70% (ice-cold)
- Tris buffer

#### Procedure
1. Grow bacterial strains in 5-10 ml of liquid medium overnight to get to high cell densities
2. Pellet the cells by centrifuging 10' @ 7000 rpm
3. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µL extraction buffer EX. Vortex briefly to resuspend
4. Add 20 µL Lysozyme solution and mix by inversion
5. Incubate 10' @ 37°C in the incubator possibly shaking
6. Vortex 30 sec
7. Add 50 µL SDS and incubate 30' @ 65°C in the water bath. Vortex every 10'
8. Add 1 volumes of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol and invert vigorously for 100 times
9. Centrifuge 3' @ 14000 rpm
10. Take the aqueous phase avoiding the interface and transfer in a new 2 mL tube
11. Repeat step 8, 9 and 10
12. Add 1 volumes of Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol and invert vigorously for 100 times
13. 9. Centrifuge 3' @ 14000 rpm
14. Take the aqueous phase avoiding the interface and transfer in a new 2 mL tube
15. Add 0.1 volumes of Na-Acetate and 0.7 volumes of Isopropanol. Mix by inversion
16. Precipitate the DNA for 2 hours @ -20°C **OR** overnight at room temperature (_if unsure ask for directions_)
15. Centrifuge 30' @ 14000 rpm @ 4°C and carefully remove the supernatant
14. Add 0.5 mL of ice cold EtOH 70%
15. Centrifuge 5' @ 14000 rpm and remove the supernatant
16. Dry 15-30' @ 37°C or on the bench until the there is no more visible liquid. Do not overdry your pellet
17. Resuspend with 50 µL of TRIS buffer pH 8.0 and transfer in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf / ***Optional***: resuspend in 50 µL of pure water (autoclaved and 0.22 µm filtered MilliQ)
18. Clearly label the tube with the sample name, date and gDNA label indication (example: st21 gDNA 5.12.19)
20. Quantify the concentration and 260/280 ratio at the NanoDrop
21. Run on 1-1.2% agarose gel to visualize the extracted DNA
22. Store frozen at -20 °C

#### Expected results
Expect between 500 and 2000 ng/µL of high quality genomic DNA

#### Common problems and troubleshooting
- If excessive DNA shear appears reduce the vortexing steps and minimize pipetting
- If low DNA concentrations are obtained start from a larger volume of culture
- Phase inversion is possible at step 8-9. Be careful to recover the aqueous phase (generally on top, but not always). Be sure to check. If phase inversion happens, remove NaCl from the extraction buffer and consider adding few washes before step 4
