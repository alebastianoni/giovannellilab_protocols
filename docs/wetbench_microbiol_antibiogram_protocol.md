# Antibiogram testing of pure strains

**OBJ**: Testing the sensibility or resistance of a pure strain to different antibiotics

>***Duration: -***

> ***Adapted from: McFarland et al.,  https://pdf4pro.com/amp/view/mcfarland-standard-dalynn-f76d0.html, and from Matuschek et al., 2014 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12373)***

#### Materials
- plate 90mm
- falcon tube 15mL
- couvette UV/VIS
- Mueller Hinton media

#### Equipment
- dry incubator at 37°C
- shaking incubator at 37°C
- spectrophotometer UV/VIS
- paper disks

#### Solutions
- Antibiotic solutions to be tested with a working concentration

## Procedure
1. Glycerol stock (-80 °C) of your stain
2. Streak on Mueller-Hinton agar plate (12h at 37 °C dry incubator)
3. Inoculate a single colony in 5ml of mueller hinton liquid media (~12 h at 37 °C shaking incubator). you need to know the hours passed between the starting of the inoculum and the lecture at the spectrophotometer
4. Read the OD 625 nm value at spectrophotometer. dilute the sample 1:10 (100 µL of sample in 900 µL of liquid media; 0.5 mcfarland = 1 - 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL → OD = 0.08 - 0.1)
5. Dilute your sample until you reach an  OD 625 nm value comprises between 0.08 and 0.1
6. Prepare plate with a base of Mueller-Hinton agar 1.8 % (10/15 mL)
7. Add on the surface 10ml of mueller hinton agar 0.7 % with 1 mL of your sample (9 mL of MH agar 0.7 % + 1 mL of sample + shaking)
8. After media solidification, add paper disks and wet with antibiotic (liquid volume required for wet the disk is 5 µL)
9. Incubate for 12 h at 37 °C dry incubator
10. Check for halo presence/absence or measure the diameter
